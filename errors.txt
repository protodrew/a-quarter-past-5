    N: I haven’t even finished buying a ticket for the day from Rosa when Herbert comes dashing around the corner, smoke smothered by the way his sneakers skid across the floor as he throws an accusatory finger in my direction.

File "game/script.rpy", line 486: expected statement.
    Herbert: Y-you!!
           ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 487: expected statement.
    PRO: Me?
       ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 488: expected statement.
    Herbert: You’re… here again. How dare you show your face, after all you did--!

    Herbert: W-wha…

File "game/script.rpy", line 492: expected statement.
    PRO: Like, are you challenging me to a duel or something? Are we destined to fight to the death?
       ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 493: expected statement.
    PRO: Or are you just a bitter rival sort of character that ends up dying early on to show how serious the real villain is?
       ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 494: expected statement.
    Herbert: I, uh--
           ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 495: expected statement.
    Herbert: I definitely don’t know what you’re talking about, but I’m guessing from… from c-context clues, I’d be the former, right?
           ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 496: expected statement.
    Herbert: ‘Cause I’m not gonna rest until you’re dead! Mark my words!

    Rosa: You should be careful about sayin’ stuff like that, champ.

File "game/script.rpy", line 498: expected statement.
    N: Rosa cuts back into the conversation as she hands me my ticket back, looking at Herbert with a smile that doesn’t reach her eyes.
     ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 499: expected statement.
    Rosa: Let’s try and keep things nice and friendly here, right?
        ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 500: expected statement.
    Herbert: Y… yes ma’am.
           ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 501: expected statement.
    N: Herbert pulls back like some sort of sullen puppy. I wave goodbye to Rosa before following Herbert into the arcade.
     ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 502: expected statement.
    PRO: So, what’s the plan for today?
       ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 503: expected statement.
    Herbert: The… the plan?
           ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 504: expected statement.
    PRO: I mean, are we gonna fight? Since I made you cry yesterday, I think it’s only fair that I hang out with you today to smooth things out.
       ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 505: expected statement.
    Herbert: I-I mean--
           ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 506: expected statement.
    PRO: You want to play some games or something? Since we’re in an arcade and all.
       ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 507: expected statement.
    PRO: Unless yesterday got you so choked up n’ traumatized that you can’t look at a game console again. Which is, like, totally fair.
       ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 508: expected statement.
    Herbert: N-no! I can--
           ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 509: expected statement.
    N: Herbert stumbles over his words before frowning, stuck with newfound determination.

File "game/script.rpy", line 511: expected statement.
    PRO: Man, you sound so serious.
       ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 512: expected statement.
    Herbert: B-because I am! I refuse to let things end the way they did!
           ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 513: expected statement.
    PRO: And you say you aren’t an anime protag…
       ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 514: expected statement.
    N: Despite his words, we set upon the nearest game console in earnest. Though I defeated him soundly last time, he seems to have approached some sort of solace in his own head and doesn’t look like he’s going to cry this time around if I beat him.

File "game/script.rpy", line 516: expected statement.
    N: When the game has finished, Herbert leans back and laughs heartily from besides me.
     ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 517: expected statement.
    PRO: So I take it you had fun?
       ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 518: expected statement.
    Herbert: Did I? Did I--
           ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 519: expected statement.
    N: He looks at me with such a look of genuine excitement that it feels physically painful when he remembers himself and coughs into his hand, collecting himself together and patting down his shirt as if it would keep him grounded.
     ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 520: expected statement.
    Herbert: Y-yeah. I had. A small amount of fun. A decent dollop of it, if you willwould.
           ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 521: expected statement.
    N: I laugh and shove him playfully.
     ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 522: expected statement.
    PRO: Who even speaks like that? What are you, from the 1800s?
       ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 523: expected statement.
    Herbert: H-hey--!
           ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 524: expected statement.
    N: He says that, but he’s laughing too.
     ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 525: expected statement.
    PRO: Anyway, I had fun. Is this how you play with people when you aren’t being an over competitive dick?
       ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 526: expected statement.
    N: His laughter dies off, and it’s as he looks at me all too guiltily that I wonder if I’ve pushed his buttons a little too accurately.
     ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 527: expected statement.
    Herbert: I, uh…
           ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 528: expected statement.
    Herbert: Don’t really. Play with people just casually, I guess.
           ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 529: expected statement.
    Herbert: I play against them, and I win, and that’s like… my thing?
           ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 530: expected statement.
    N: He laughs nervously, but there’s no humor in it.
     ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 531: expected statement.
    Herbert: So when you beat me, I kinda got super stressed over it and. I dunno, it kinda sucked.
           ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 532: expected statement.
    Herbert: S-so I’m trying to play more with you now, and not think about it too much.
           ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 533: expected statement.
    PRO: Huh.
       ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 534: expected statement.
    PRO: Well, I didn’t ask for your whole backstory or anything, but thanks for that, I guess--
       ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 535: expected statement.
    Herbert: A-a backstory?!
           ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 536: expected statement.
    Herbert: Why would you call it th--
           ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 537: expected statement.
    N: I can’t help but laugh good naturedly at how flustered he looks.
     ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 538: expected statement.
    N: We manage to share a few more good small conversations over the next few hours, buying out all the snacks from a vending machine and dirtying up the game consoles with our chip dust covered fingers.
     ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 539: expected statement.
    N: Despite everything, I feel closer to Herbert than I do to most people. He’s awkward, but ends up being genuine with his actions, even if he tries hard to be mean. Like some sort of pissed off kitten.
     ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 540: expected statement.
    N: But the hours roll on by quickly enough, and before long, it’s time to head home.
     ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 541: expected statement.
    Herbert: So, uh…
           ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 542: expected statement.
    N: He hesitates to say it, but it comes out anyway.
     ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 543: expected statement.
    Herbert: See you tomorrow? For another round?
           ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 544: expected statement.
    PRO: Of course! If you’re not there, I’d be disappointed.
       ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 545: expected statement.
    N: He smiles cheekily at me, relieved.
     ^

File "game/script.rpy", line 546: expected statement.
    N: Guess I’ll see him tomorrow.

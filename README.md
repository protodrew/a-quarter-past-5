# About 

During the last 5 days of the earth you have decided to spend your time in the Quarter Round arcade, meeting 3 colorful characters.

This is a short visual novel made by three WPI students for their  Interactive Media and Game Design course. The game was made in 4 weeks  and all resources except for the music were produced by the three of us. The music is from [One Man symphony](https://onemansymphony.bandcamp.com) licensed under Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) License.
